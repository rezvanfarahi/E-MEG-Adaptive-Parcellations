1- ?h.fsaverage_RegionGrowing_70.annot refers to the parcellation obtained from region growing algorithm (one file per hemisphere)
2- ?h.fsaverage_Modified_DKA_74parcels.annot refers to the parcellation obtained from split-and-merge algorithm applied to Desikan-Killiany Atlas

The file formats are similar to freesurfer's cortical parcellations (i.e. annot files):
